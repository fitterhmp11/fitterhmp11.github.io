# Podcasts – January 2025

## Security Now (SN) 1010
- Cloudflare reports a **53% increase** in DDoS attacks in 2024 compared to 2023.

  - Certificates add an average of **3-6 KB** in size.
  - Uses **port 853**.
  - Creates a TLS connection to a remote DNS server over a URL.
  - **TLS RADIUS server** must maintain state and track secret session keys, making it much more resource-intensive than UDP.

### Takeaways:
- Track daily work.
- Record wins and completed projects.
- Blog more and improve writing skills.

## Security Now (SN) 1008
- **HTOP and TOTP** use **HMAC-SHA1** message digests to generate unique seeds for each client.
- When combined with day and time, this generates an SHA1 HMAC digest, which is then used to create a one-time password (OTP).
- **SHA1 is still secure** and valid for generating unique 160-bit digests that cannot be reverse-engineered, though it has been deprecated for other cryptographic purposes (e.g., digital signatures).

- **SonicWall NSA SSL VPN vulnerability** from August 2024 is still actively exploited.
