## Core IT Operations and Development Roles

### 1. **DevOps (Development and Operations)**
   - **Responsibilities**: Streamlines software development by bridging development and operations. Focuses on continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) to enable rapid, reliable deployments.
   - **Skills**: Scripting (Python, Bash), infrastructure automation (Ansible, Terraform), containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), cloud (AWS, Azure), CI/CD (Jenkins, GitLab CI).
   - **Difference**: Integrates development and operations with a focus on automation and efficiency.

### 2. **NetOps (Network Operations)**
   - **Responsibilities**: Manages network operations, ensuring network performance, uptime, and security through automation.
   - **Skills**: Network automation, SDN, monitoring tools (Nagios, SolarWinds), network protocols, scripting.
   - **Difference**: NetOps emphasizes network infrastructure operations, unlike DevOps which integrates application development and IT infrastructure.


### CyberSecurity-Centric Roles

### 3. **SecDevOps (Security Development and Operations)**
   - **Responsibilities**: Extends DevOps with integrated security (shift-left approach), embedding security in CI/CD pipelines.
   - **Skills**: Security tools (SAST, DAST), vulnerability scanning, cloud security, automated compliance.
   - **Difference**: Adds security as a core element within DevOps, ensuring secure coding and configurations.

### 4. **SOC Team (Security Operations Center)**
   - **Responsibilities**: Monitors and responds to cybersecurity incidents, manages security tools, and investigates alerts.
   - **Skills**: SIEM (Splunk, QRadar), threat intelligence, incident response, malware analysis.
   - **Difference**: Focuses exclusively on cybersecurity, actively protecting against threats.

### 5. **NOC Team (Network Operations Center)**
   - **Responsibilities**: Ensures network stability and performance, monitors devices, troubleshoots network issues.
   - **Skills**: Network monitoring (Zabbix, PRTG), basic troubleshooting, network protocols (TCP/IP, BGP, OSPF).
   - **Difference**: Ensures network health and availability, while SOC focuses on security incidents.

## Network and Security Engineering Roles

### 6. **Network Engineer**
   - **Responsibilities**: Designs and maintains network infrastructure, ensuring secure, scalable connectivity.
   - **Skills**: Routing and switching, network architecture, firewalls, VPNs.
   - **Difference**: Focuses on network design, while NetOps emphasizes network automation.

### 7. **Security Network Engineer**
   - **Responsibilities**: Designs secure network infrastructures, focusing on firewall, IDS/IPS, VPN configurations.
   - **Skills**: Firewall management (Palo Alto, Fortinet), IDS/IPS, encryption.
   - **Difference**: Prioritizes network security, in contrast to a network engineerâ€™s focus on performance.

## IT Administration Roles

### 8. **Network Administrator**
   - **Responsibilities**: Manages day-to-day network operations, maintains network devices, ensures service availability.
   - **Skills**: Network troubleshooting, hardware configuration, LAN/WAN management.
   - **Difference**: Primarily focused on network maintenance, unlike network engineers who focus on infrastructure design.

### 9. **System Administrator**
   - **Responsibilities**: Manages computer systems, including servers, operating systems, user management, and backups.
   - **Skills**: Operating systems (Linux, Windows), server management, virtualization (VMware, Hyper-V).
   - **Difference**: Focuses on server and OS health, while network administrators manage network infrastructure.

## Web Development Role

### 10. **Web Developer**
   - **Responsibilities**: Designs, builds, and maintains websites and web applications.
   - **Skills**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, front-end frameworks (React, Angular), back-end development (Node.js, PHP), databases (SQL, NoSQL).
   - **Difference**: Creates and maintains websites, distinct from infrastructure-focused roles.

---

## Cybersecurity Roles

### 11. **Cybersecurity Analyst**
   - **Responsibilities**: Monitors and defends systems from cyber threats, performs security audits, and incident response.
   - **Skills**: Security frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001), SIEM, vulnerability management, malware analysis.
   - **Difference**: Addresses security across systems and data, beyond just network security.

## Summary of Key Differences
1. **DevOps** and **SecDevOps** streamline development and operations, with SecDevOps adding a security focus.
2. **NetOps** specializes in network automation, while **NOC** and **SOC** teams monitor networks and security, respectively.
3. **Network engineers** and **security network engineers** focus on infrastructure, with the latter emphasizing security.
4. **Network administrators** handle network maintenance, while **system administrators** manage servers.
5. **Web developers** focus on building websites, distinct from infrastructure roles.
6. **Cybersecurity analysts** cover a broader security spectrum, focusing on protection beyond the network layer.
