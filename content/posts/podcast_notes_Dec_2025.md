# Below are some  interesting points I found from podcasts listened to during December 2025

## **Security Now! #1054: Bots in the Belfry**

### **Key Points:**

* **Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters vs. Salesforce Ecosystem:** A new threat actor amalgam (Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and ShinyHunters) has targeted third-party tools with API access to Salesforce data—specifically Gainsight. While Salesforce and its customers reported no direct platform breach, the incident highlights a massive supply-chain risk: the security of external services that possess high-level API permissions to sensitive customer environments.
* **Cisco's Pivot to Secure-by-Design:** Cisco has announced a significant shift in its device design philosophy. This move transitions from merely warning users about insecure defaults to removing insecure features entirely. The goal is a "secure networking" environment where devices are hardened by default, requiring less manual intervention from engineers to maintain a secure baseline.

## **Laketec: The Network Buzz — The Future of E-Rate**

### **Key Points:**

* **E-Rate Foundations:** Established as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (starting in 1998) and overseen by the FCC, E-Rate provides vital funding for schools and libraries. It is funded via the Universal Service Fee on consumer phone bills rather than through general tax revenue.
* **Funding Categories:** The program is divided into **Category 1** (connectivity to the building) and **Category 2** (internal connections/managed internal broadband services).
* **Expansion of Access:** Since 2015, the program has evolved to ensure that every eligible applicant has a predictable path to funding, focusing on modernizing classroom connectivity and, more recently, looking at cybersecurity pilot programs.
