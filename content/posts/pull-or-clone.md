It depends on whether the local folder already has a Git repository linked to the remote repository.

### If You Don’t Have a Local Copy Yet:
You should **clone** the repository. The `git clone` command will copy the entire repository (including all branches and commit history) from the remote server to your local machine. For example:

```bash
git clone <repository-URL>
```

This will create a new folder containing the repository.

### If You Already Have a Local Copy:
You should **pull** to fetch and merge the latest changes from the remote repository into your local branch. The `git pull` command does the following:
1. Fetches updates from the remote branch.
2. Merges them into your current local branch.

Use this command inside the folder of your existing local repository:

```bash
git pull
```

### Summary:
- **`git clone`**: When you’re setting up the repository locally for the first time.
- **`git pull`**: When you already have the repository and want to sync it with the remote.
