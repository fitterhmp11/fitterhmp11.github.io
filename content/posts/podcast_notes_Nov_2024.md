# Below are some  interesting points I found from podcasts listened to during November 2024


**You can’t manage something unless you monitor.**

**every problem is a people, process or technology problem**



## HS088 - Analysis paralysis
Don’t plan for everything, take a dev or agile approach - get it up and go, then revisit

There is no perfect solution.

A 5 whys problem (after clearly defining the problem, ask and answer "why?" repeatedly 5 times to get to the root of the problem).
It’s too much analysis bc haven’t effectively scoped the problem.

You don’t want to develop the perfect architecture or strategy.  Want good enough that can be changed, so can move forward to getting starting to work

Agile = minimum viable product

A self improving system is better than a perfect system 

Launch and correct, launch and correct.  
Resist the urge to try to mitigate every problem that comes up. just flag it, mark move on. "Acknowledge that we see it. We don’t have a solution for it now but we are prepared to confront it if that problem arises."


The problem with overextending the analysis phase is that you keep pushing out and pushing out the solution and so so much time has passed that the problem has changed and so that now more analysis planning needs to be done.

Distinguish between the "threat to the project" type of problem from "this will be an ongoing annoyance" type of problem and act accordingly.


Magazine executive - read a magazine about new idea then tell team to do it, team spends time researching then it’s forgotten

## TNO006: Network Operations is Where It’s At

Not one approach network automation, there will be multiple.  
It’s not the single best product that succeeds, there are people involved and emotions involved in decisions

Shift is coming, but can’t just fire everyone and hire new. We owe it to people to help them learn the new skills that they’ll need

Bank seems to be too big to fail in IT. It seems too big to succeed. A better approach is to make changes in small batches. Also consider the blast radius” blast radius is how many people be affected by the change entire data structure all users or just a sub considering this helps.

Cloud companies have a mindset that is not afraid of change. In fact they approach it is something desired instead of rolling back. They push forward.

There’s some companies in industries that dev ops is not the correct approach to the software development cycle will be more like network operations, COI and other tools
