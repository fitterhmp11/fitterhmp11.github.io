# Abstract
An "old-world" network engineer, leveraging 20+ years of networking experience to explore "new-world" concepts.

Topics will focus on increasing my understanding of cybersecurity, networking, network automation, network observability, virtualization, cloud networking, linux, python, programming and misc tips I find useful and meaningful.

# Learn by Doing
Recognizing my tendency to always start from the basics and slowly proceed systematically, I often find I get distracted before I can make any meaningful progress.
Because of this, I'm shifting to **learning by doing** approach.  The focus will be on small tasks, projects and posts in order apply unfamiliar concepts and technologies, allowing me to grow in knowledge, understanding, and experience.

# Intent of Website
This website intends to be documentation resource for new skills and learning gained.
Additionally, I aim to deepen my understanding through writing, while potentially providing content that may be helpful to others.

# Use of AI
I will make use AI to help develop this website and assist with my learning as much as possible. 
Regarding content, AI tools will be used to help generate ideas, research topics, provide feedback on readability and answer my questions.
I will be leaning heavily on AI to help me learn new topics.  For example, using to write and troubleshoot scripts.  I will also make note of AI queries used.

All content will be my own, and thus will be reviewed and edited by me before posting. 
If any content is entirely AI generated, it will be marked as such.
