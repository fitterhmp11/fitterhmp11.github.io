# Abstract
An "old-world" network engineer, leveraging 20+ years of networking experience to explore "new-world" concepts as I see the changes in the industry.

Topics will focus on increasing my understanding of cybersecurity, networking, network automation, network observability, virtualization, cloud networking, linux, python, programming and misc tips I find useful and meaningful.

# Learn by Doing
This site is primarily a technical learning repo. I use it to keep track of what I’m learning and to "show my work" as I develop new skills. If the notes here happen to help someone else solve a problem, that’s even better.

# How I Use AI
I use AI as a tool to speed up my learning. It acts as a pair programmer for troubleshooting scripts, a research assistant for new topics, and an editor for my notes. 

While AI helps with the heavy lifting, I personally review and test everything before it gets posted. If I use a specific AI query to build something, I’ll usually make a note of it in the post.

# The Fine Print
This is a personal project. The opinions are mine, and the technical notes are for educational use. Always test configurations in a lab before you even think about putting them into a production environment.
